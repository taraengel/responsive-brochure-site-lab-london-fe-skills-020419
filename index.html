            <h3>Post Punk: A small history</h3>
            <p>Post-punk is a genre that developed from the dwindling punk rock era.  It began its roots in 1977 with a claim by many from the era that Siouxsie & The Banshees were officially the first post-punk band to emerge from the scene.  It certainly was not popular at the current time, many bands were signed to independent labels that were just beginning.  Many of these independent labels started as a response to the now dwindling original punk scene.  It was an interesting time, the original punk scene was mainly focused on pure rock whereas post-punk was a broader option, allowing bands & artists to express their music using other influences such as funk, avant-garde, dub, jazz, art pop including a few more.
    
            Post-punk was more popular in the United Kingdom & America.  Talking Heads were perhaps regarded as probably the ones who had the best success from the period.  The UK however… its pretty hard to nail down who had the best success as many of the acts from the era moved on to great success as post-punk and new wave.  If a band had to be named it would probably be U2.  They began their music careers during the post-punk period but changed their style slightly over the years.  However, they still play today, a testament to a bands longevity.
            
            Post-punk had a pretty good shelf life though.  Signs of the music genre began dwindling began around the early-mid eighties when many bands moved over to a commercial sound, mainly down to the fact that these bands or artists were now signed to big record labels.  As everyone should know, the music industry is a fickle business and to survive you must adapt or die.  Once your fan base falls below a standard, you were abandoned before you knew it.</p>

                <p>Parquet Courts are a 4-piece Post-punk band from New York. Andrew Savage and Austin Brown on vocals, with Sean Yeaton on bass and Max Savage on drums. Their first release was in 2011.
                In 2014, the band reached #55 on the Billboard albums chart with its third studio album, Sunbathing Animal. Later in 2014, the band released "Uncast Shadow of a Southern Myth" as a single under an alternative name, Parkay Quarts. Soon after they released their fourth studio album, Content Nausea, on which Sean and Max were absent, due to other commitments. The following year, the band released a mostly instrumental, experimental EP, entitled Monastic Living.

                On February 4, 2016, the band announced their fifth studio album, entitled Human Performance. The album was released on April 8 through Rough Trade.
                On October 13, 2017, the band's co-frontman A. Savage released his first solo album, Thawing Dawn, through Dull Tools.</p>

              <p>Television group was founded by Tom Verlaine on guitar and vocals, Richard Lloyd on guitar, Billy Ficca on drums and Richard Hell on bass and vocals back in the 1970s.<br>If ever a band was a product of a particular time and place, it’s Television. If ever there was a record indebted to that same time and place, it’s Marquee Moon.
                The guitar rock masterpiece, which married artful technicality with the menace and energy of New York’s then-nascent punk scene, took rock and roll into arenas that had not yet been named at the time of its 1977 release. Today, you can call it underground, indie, whatever you want. What’s less subject for debate is the record’s influence. In eight tracks, Marquee Moon cast a spell on generations of future guitar misfits, many of which, including Pavement, Sonic Youth, and Built to Spill, would rise to prominence during the guitar rock heyday of the ’90s.</p>
